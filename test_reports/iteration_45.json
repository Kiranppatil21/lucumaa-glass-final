    "1. Glass configurator loads at /customize with dropdown menus": "PASS - Page loads with 'Book Your Glass' title, 5 dropdown menus visible",
    "2. Glass panel remains FIXED and does not move during interactions": "PASS - Glass mesh created once with unit size, scaled via scaling property - never recreated",
    "3. Shape placement works - click shape button, then click on glass": "PASS - Placement mode activates, shape placed at click position",
    "4. Shape shows 8 resize handles and 1 rotation handle when selected": "PASS - 8 blue resize handles + 1 green rotation handle visible",
    "5. Shape can be dragged to move - position updates smoothly": "PASS - Direct state updates during drag, smooth movement",
    "6. Inner dimension label stays attached to shape during drag": "PASS - Labels 'H Ø50' and 'R 100×80' stay attached",
    "7. Edge distance labels update in real-time during drag": "PASS - Red distance labels (←, →, ↑, ↓) update correctly",
    "8. Shape is preserved after drag (Cutouts count remains 1)": "PASS - Cutouts count preserved after drag operations",
